## ReadyForCoffee

This is an experimental app. It is using the [Multipeer Connectivity Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/Reference/MultipeerConnectivityFramework/index.html) to synchronize a "ready"-state among devices on the same network. The idea is to use this app in a team on the same network and allow them to see how many of them are ready for a small coffee break.

### Features

* The app is currently only synchronizing the "ready"-state of every connected peer.
